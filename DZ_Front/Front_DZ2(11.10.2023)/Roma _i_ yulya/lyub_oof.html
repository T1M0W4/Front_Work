                In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
                From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, <br>
                Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br><br>

                                Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
                                Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br> <br>

                                                Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
                                                Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>

                                                What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.<br>
